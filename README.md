# Thesis
__Automated Machine Learning for Protein Classification__

This repository contains code developed for my Master's thesis, titled:  
**"Developing an Automated Machine and Deep Learning Framework for Protein Classification"**, conducted in collaboration with OmniumAI.

Due to OmniumAIâ€™s sharing policies, not all the code developed during the project is included in this repository. Instead, the focus here is on scripts for data exploration, comparative analysis using Propythia, and the implementation of the general **OmniA** pipeline.

## __Installation Requirements__

To run the code in this repository, Python 3.10.12 is required. Below are the steps to set up the environment:

1. Install the necessary wheel packages- OmniA:
   pip install "path_to_wheels"

2. Install Propythia:
   pip install propythia

## __Contents__

This repository is structured into three key files, each focused on a different aspect of protein sequence analysis:
  Data: Provides a superficial analysis of the datasets used in this thesis.
  OmniA: Demonstrates how to run individual and global pipelines for the case studies related to protein classification.
  Propythia: Shows how to run Propythia using a general script. This script applies various types of numerical representations for protein sequences and can be used for protein classification problems.

## __Resume__

This project automates protein classification using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It explores the use of Propythia for comparative analysis and the OmniA platform for building robust pipelines.
